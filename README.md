### Course Description
The 21st century has seen a big increase in the amount of data which is
made accessible. Social media such as
Facebook, online shops such as Amazon and many others, are all gathering
raw data. But what can be done about
this data?
Data Science covers tools and methods around the extraction of knowledge
from data. Such tools cover its
collection, storing, processing and analysis. In this course we will
learn about several of the most important tools in
the above flow and will apply them to real-world examples.

### Resources

* **Text book:**
    * REQUIRED: Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking by Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett (DSB)

### Attendance Policy
Attendance is mandatory in all classes and attendance affects the grade. In case of four unexcused absents, a grade of "F" is automatically given.


IN ALL CASES OF MISSED COURSE MEETINGS, THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR
COMMUNICATION WITH THE PROFESSOR, AND FOR ARRANGING TO MAKE UP MISSED
WORK, RESTS SOLELY WITH THE STUDENT.

Whether an absence is excused or not is ALWAYS up to the discretion of
the professor or the department. Unexcused absences can result in a low
or failing participation grade. In the case of excessive absences, it is
up to the professor or the department to decide if the student will
receive an "F" for the course. An instructor may recommend that a
student withdraw, if absences have made it impossible to continue in the
course at a satisfactory level.
Students must be mindful of this policy when making their travel
arrangements, and especially during the Drop/Add and Exam Periods.

### Grading Policy
* 10% midterm
* 20% participation and attendance
* 40% exercises
* 30% project

### Learning Outcome
Students will learn in parallel the fundamental ideas of Data Science as
well as tp use the Python language and Jupyer Notebook.
Students should be able to digitally obtain and parse
datasets and to model them in various ways in
order to be able to draw information from the data.
